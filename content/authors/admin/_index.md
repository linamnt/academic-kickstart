I'm a PhD Candidate in th dept. of Physiology at the University of Toronto. 
I currently study the impact of newly generated neurons during adulthood 
on learning and memory as a member of the [Frankland lab](jflab.ca) at the Hospital for Sick Children.
To do this, I build artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model the biological neural networks I'm interested in. 
I won't go so far as to say (right now) that our brains work like ANNs, but I do 
think there is insight to be gained from the field of deep learning that can be useful in neuroscience. 

## Outside of the lab:
Learning to Teach Programming
- I organize and teach programming lessons with a focus on research applications of coding through a graduate student led group, [UofT Coders](uoftcoders.github.io)
- I am a certified Software Carpentry workshop instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a worldwide network of instructors that teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers.
